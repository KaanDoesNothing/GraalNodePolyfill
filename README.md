# GraalNodePolyfill
GraalNodePolyfill is an attempt to polyfill
certain parts of the NodeJS API to work in a
CommonJS environment (specifically GraalJS via
[this project](https://github.com/Mythical-Forest-Collective/graaljs-interpreter)
but is also intended to work on [Grakkit](https://github.com/Grakkit/Grakkit)
which is a project that brings the world of JS to
Minecraft).


This project is is a work in progress, and is nowhere
*near* ready for use yet!
